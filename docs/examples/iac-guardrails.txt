**CUSTOM SECURITY GUARDRAILS:**

You MUST prioritize the following specific security checks with HIGH severity:

**S3 Bucket Public Access Prevention**:
   - Look for any S3 buckets with `bucket_public_access_block` disabled
   - Flag any S3 bucket policy that allows `Principal: "*"`
   - Check for ACLs that grant public read/write access
   - Verify that `block_public_acls = true` and `block_public_policy = true`

**Database Encryption Requirements**:
   - ALL RDS instances MUST have `storage_encrypted = true`
   - Check for any database without encryption at rest enabled
   - Verify that backup encryption is enabled

**Network Security Enforcement**:
   - Security groups MUST NOT allow inbound traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 on ports 22, 3389, or 1433
   - Look for overly permissive NACL rules
   - Check that load balancers use HTTPS/SSL certificates

**IAM Policy Restrictions**:
   - Flag any IAM policy with `Effect: "Allow"` and `Action: "*"` 
   - Look for policies granting `iam:*` permissions
   - Check for hardcoded AWS credentials in resource configurations

**S3 Bucket Naming Conventions**:
   - Flag any bucket that does not have the prefix "company-"
   - Flag any bucket that does not match the regex "company-{bucket-name}-{env}" where env can be dev, staging, or prod

**REPORTING REQUIREMENTS:**
- Treat violations of these guardrails as HIGH SEVERITY findings
- Include the specific guardrail violation in the vulnerability title
- Provide exact remediation steps for each guardrail violation
- Reference the line numbers and file paths where violations occur
