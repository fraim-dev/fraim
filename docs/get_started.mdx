Welcome to Fraim - AI-powered security workflows that help security teams identify vulnerabilities, assess risks, and understand systems at scale.

## What is Fraim?

Fraim provides specialized security workflows powered by AI. Instead of one-size-fits-all scanning, you get targeted analysis tools designed for specific security tasks - from finding vulnerabilities in application code to assessing risks in infrastructure changes.

## Workflows

Fraim offers specialized workflows, each optimized for different security needs:

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Risk Assessment
**Flag changes that need security review**

Analyzes code changes in pull requests to identify modifications that could introduce security risks, automatically notifying security teams when review is needed.

```bash
# Assess risks in code changes
fraim run risk_flagger --location . --diff --pr-url $PR_URL --approver security-team
```

**Best for**: Pull request security gates, change management, security team triage

### üîç Code Security Analysis
**Find vulnerabilities in application code**

Analyzes source code across multiple languages to identify security vulnerabilities like injection flaws, XSS, authentication issues, and hardcoded secrets.

```bash
# Scan your application code
fraim run code --location .
```

**Best for**: Application security reviews, vulnerability scanning, pre-deployment security checks

### üèóÔ∏è Infrastructure Security Analysis  
**Identify misconfigurations in infrastructure code**

Examines infrastructure-as-code files (Terraform, Kubernetes, Docker) for security misconfigurations and compliance violations.

```bash
# Scan infrastructure configurations
fraim run iac --location .
```

**Best for**: Cloud security, DevOps security, infrastructure compliance

### üìã System Understanding
**Extract system context for threat modeling**

Analyzes documentation and code structure to understand system purpose, users, data flows, and external integrations - perfect for threat modeling preparation.

```bash
# Understand your system
fraim run system_analysis --location . --business-context "E-commerce platform"
```

**Best for**: Threat modeling, security assessments, system documentation

## Key Features

### üéØ Specialized Analysis
Each workflow is optimized for specific security tasks, providing more accurate and actionable results than generic scanning tools.

### ü§ñ AI-Powered Intelligence
Uses advanced language models to understand context, reduce false positives, and provide detailed explanations of security findings.

### üîó Seamless Integration
Works with your existing development workflow - analyze local code, remote repositories, or integrate into CI/CD pipelines.

### üìä Industry-Standard Output
Generates SARIF reports compatible with security platforms and HTML reports for human review.

## Quick Start

### 1. Install Fraim
```bash
pip install fraim
```

### 2. Set up API Key
```bash
# For the default model (Claude)
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
```

### 3. Run Your First Analysis
```bash
# Analyze your current project for vulnerabilities
fraim run code --location .

# Or assess risks in a pull request
fraim run risk_flagger --location . --diff
```

## Choose Your Workflow

### For Application Security Teams
**Start with**: [Code Security Analysis](workflows/code.mdx)
- Scan application code for vulnerabilities
- Integrate into development workflows
- Generate compliance reports

### For DevOps/Platform Teams  
**Start with**: [Infrastructure Analysis](workflows/iac.mdx)

## Common Use Cases

### Security Code Reviews
```bash
# Comprehensive application security scan
fraim run code --location . --confidence 7
```

### CI/CD Security Gates
```bash
# Risk-based pull request analysis
fraim run risk_flagger --location . --diff --pr-url $PR_URL --approver security-team
```

### Infrastructure Security
```bash
# Scan infrastructure configurations
fraim run iac --location . --confidence 8
```

### Threat Modeling Prep
```bash
# Generate system understanding
fraim run system_analysis --location . --business-context "Customer portal application"
```

### Security Assessment Workflow
```bash
# Complete security assessment process
fraim run system_analysis --location .  # Understand the system
fraim run code --location .             # Find vulnerabilities  
fraim run iac --location .              # Check infrastructure
```
