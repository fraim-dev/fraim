# System Analysis Workflow

The **System Analysis** workflow examines codebases and documentation to extract system purpose, intended users, and business context. This workflow is perfect for understanding unfamiliar systems, generating threat models, or creating system documentation.

## Overview

- **Workflow ID**: `system_analysis`
- **Primary Use Case**: System understanding and threat modeling preparation
- **Output**: JSON report with system characteristics

**Common focus areas:**
- `authentication` - User authentication and session management
- `authorization` - Access control and permissions
- `data_processing` - Data handling and storage
- `api_endpoints` - API design and external interfaces
- `user_management` - User roles and account management
- `payment_processing` - Financial transactions
- `security` - Security controls and measures
- `compliance` - Regulatory and compliance features
- `integration` - External system integrations
- `monitoring` - Logging and observability

## Common Use Cases

### 1. Threat Modeling Preparation
```bash
# Generate system understanding for threat modeling
fraim run system_analysis --location . \
  --business-context "Customer-facing web application" \
  --focus-areas "authentication,data_processing,external_integrations"
```

### 2. Security Assessment Kickoff
```bash
# Understand system before security review
fraim run system_analysis --location . \
  --focus-areas "security,authentication,data_processing"
```

### 3. Onboarding New Team Members
```bash
# Generate system overview for new developers
fraim run system_analysis --location . \
  --business-context "Internal tool for customer support team"
```

### 4. Compliance Documentation
```bash
# Understand system for compliance assessment
fraim run system_analysis --location . \
  --business-context "Healthcare data processing system" \
  --focus-areas "data_processing,compliance,security"
```

### 5. Legacy System Analysis
```bash
# Analyze unfamiliar legacy system
fraim run system_analysis --location . \
  --business-context "Legacy financial reporting system"
```


### 6. Documentation Generation
```bash
# Generate system overview for documentation
fraim run system_analysis --location . \
  --business-context "Internal API for user management" \
  --output ./docs/analysis/
```

## Workflow-Specific Options

### `--business-context <TEXT>`
Provide additional business context to improve analysis accuracy.

```bash
# Financial services context
fraim run system_analysis --location . \
  --business-context "Banking application for retail customers"

# Healthcare context  
fraim run system_analysis --location . \
  --business-context "Patient management system for medical practices"

# E-commerce context
fraim run system_analysis --location . \
  --business-context "Online marketplace connecting buyers and sellers"
```

### `--focus-areas <AREAS>`
Specify particular areas to emphasize during analysis.

```bash
# Authentication focus
fraim run system_analysis --location . \
  --focus-areas "authentication,authorization,user_management"

# Data processing focus
fraim run system_analysis --location . \
  --focus-areas "data_processing,database,api_endpoints"

# Security focus
fraim run system_analysis --location . \
  --focus-areas "security,encryption,access_control,audit_logging"
```
