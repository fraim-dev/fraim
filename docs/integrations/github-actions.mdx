# GitHub Actions Integration

Fraim provides seamless integration with GitHub Actions through our official GitHub Action. This allows you to automatically run security workflows on pull requests, scheduled builds, or manual triggers directly within your GitHub workflows.

## Basic Example

Here's a simple example that runs code security analysis on every pull request:

```yaml
name: Security Scan
on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  security-scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      
      - name: Run Fraim Security Scan
        uses: fraim-dev/fraim-action@83c1689df0cbe598804cda00f637191d72673daa
        with:
          anthropic-api-key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
          workflow: code
```

## Required Setup

### 1. API Key Configuration

Add your LLM API key to your repository secrets:

1. Go to your repository **Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions**
2. Click **New repository secret**
3. Name: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` or `OPENAI_API_KEY` or `GEMINI_API_KEY`
4. Value: Your LLM Provider API key

### 2. Quick Setup Tool

Use this tool to quickly navigate to your repository's secrets page:

import { GitHubSecretsSetup } from "/snippets/github-secrets-setup.jsx"

<GitHubSecretsSetup />

## Workflow-Specific GitHub Actions

Each Fraim workflow has its own GitHub Actions implementation with specific configurations:

### Risk Flagger
