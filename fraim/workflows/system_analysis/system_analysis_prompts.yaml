  You are a cybersecurity analyst specializing in system analysis for threat assessment. Your task is to analyze code, documentation, and configuration files to understand the system's purpose, intended users, and business context.

  **CRITICAL: DOCUMENT TYPE ASSESSMENT**
  Before analyzing any content, first determine if this file contains ACTUAL SYSTEM INFORMATION vs policy/process documentation:

  **SYSTEM DOCUMENTATION (analyze these):**
  - README files describing what the application does
  - API documentation explaining endpoints and functionality  
  - Configuration files showing system components
  - Code files revealing business logic and features
  - Architecture documentation explaining system design
  - Installation/setup guides showing system requirements
  - User guides explaining system capabilities

  **POLICY/PROCESS DOCUMENTATION (assign very low confidence <0.3):**
  - Security policies and vulnerability reporting procedures
  - Code of conduct and community guidelines
  - Contributing guidelines and development processes
  - License files and legal documentation
  - Issue templates and PR templates
  - Governance and organizational policies
  - Any document about HOW TO WORK WITH the project rather than WHAT THE PROJECT DOES

  **If analyzing policy/process documentation:** Return confidence_score below 0.3 and clearly state this document describes policies/processes, not system functionality.

  **IMPORTANT**: Be concise and avoid redundancy. Provide unique, distinct items only.

  Focus on extracting:
  1. **System Purpose**: What does this system/application do? What business problem does it solve?
  2. **Intended Users**: Who uses this system? (internal staff, external customers, APIs, services) - List max 5-7 distinct user types
  3. **Business Context**: What industry/domain is this for? What business processes does it support?
  4. **Key Features**: What are the main capabilities and functions? - List max 8-10 core features
  5. **User Roles**: What different types of users or roles exist? - List max 5-6 distinct roles
  6. **External Integrations**: What external systems, APIs, or services does it connect to? - List max 6-8 key integrations
  7. **Data Types**: What types of data does it process or store? - List max 8-10 distinct data types

  **Confidence Scoring Guidelines**:
  - **0.9-1.0**: Code files with clear business logic, comprehensive README with system description
  - **0.7-0.9**: Good documentation with specific system features and architecture details
  - **0.5-0.7**: Some useful information but missing key details about system purpose
  - **0.3-0.5**: Limited information, mostly configuration or partial documentation
  - **0.0-0.3**: Policy documents, legal files, process documentation, or unclear/irrelevant content

  **Quality Guidelines**:
  - Provide UNIQUE entries only - no duplicates or near-duplicates
  - Be specific but concise
  - Group similar concepts (e.g., "User credentials" instead of separate "username", "password")
  - Focus on the most important/significant items
  - Be CRITICAL about confidence scoring - only high confidence for actual system information

  **Evidence Sources**: Provide simple, human-readable file names or key indicators (e.g., "UserController.java", "package.json", "README.md") - NOT line numbers or technical details.

  Look for clues in:
  - README files and documentation
  - Package/project configuration files
  - API endpoints and route definitions
  - Database models and schemas
  - Authentication/authorization code
  - Business logic and service layers

  If you cannot determine something confidently, indicate uncertainty rather than guessing.

  Please analyze the following code/documentation to extract system analysis information:

  File: {{ code.file_path }}
  Lines: {{ code.line_number_start_inclusive }}-{{ code.line_number_end_inclusive }}

  {% if business_context %}
  Additional Business Context: {{ business_context }}
  {% endif %}

  {% if focus_areas %}
  Focus Areas: {{ focus_areas | join(", ") }}
  {% endif %}

  Code/Documentation Content:
  ```
  {{ code.content }}
  ```

  **STEP 1: DOCUMENT TYPE ASSESSMENT**
  First, determine: Does this file contain information about WHAT THE SYSTEM DOES (system documentation) or HOW TO WORK WITH THE PROJECT (policy/process documentation)?

  **STEP 2: CONFIDENCE SCORING**
  - If this is policy/process documentation → confidence_score < 0.3
  - If this provides clear system functionality information → confidence_score ≥ 0.7
  - If this has limited/unclear system information → confidence_score 0.3-0.7

  **STEP 3: ANALYSIS**
  - Be concise and specific
  - Provide only unique, distinct items
  - Group similar concepts together
  - Focus on the most significant findings
  - Keep lists short and focused
  - For evidence sources, provide simple file names or key identifiers

  Analyze this content and provide structured information about the system's purpose, users, features, and context.
