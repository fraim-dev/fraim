# App Overview

Type: Library, CLI
(The project is primarily a Node.js library for parsing image dimensions, but it also provides a command-line interface.)

Primary purpose: To detect the dimensions (width and height) of various image file formats from a file path or buffer.

Key components / entry modules: The main library entry point is `lib/index.ts`, the CLI entry point is `bin/image-size.js`, and the core logic for parsing different image types is in `lib/types/*.ts`.

Evidence: package.json:2-4, package.json:40, lib/

List all the components in the project codebase, identifying their purpose and wheere they are deployed and run.

Which parts of the project are responsible for which functions?

| Path | Purpose | Execution Environment | Notes/ Evidence |
|------|---------|--------------------|------------------|
| bin/image-size.js | Command-line interface to get image dimensions. | Local Machine | package.json:40 |
| lib/index.ts | Main entry point for the library. | Library Consumer's Environment (e.g., Node.js) | package.json:4 |
| lib/fromFile.ts | Utility to get image dimensions from a file path. | Library Consumer's Environment (e.g., Node.js) | package.json:26-32 |
| lib/types/*.ts | Contains the logic for parsing specific image file formats. | Library Consumer's Environment (e.g., Node.js) | lib/types/ |
| specs/**/*.spec.ts | Test suite for the library. | Development / CI | specs/ |
| tsup.config.ts | Build configuration for bundling the library. | Development / CI | tsup.config.ts |
| pnm-prototype-pollution-poc.ts | Proof-of-concept for a potential prototype pollution vulnerability. | Development | pnm-prototype-pollution-poc.ts |

# Trust Boundaries

Where attacker-controlled data can enter or exit the system.

| Boundary | Present? | Notes / Evidence |
|----------|----------|------------------|
| Internet | No | The tool operates on local files and does not appear to make network requests. |
| Internal Network | No | The tool operates on local files and does not appear to make network requests. |
| Local Machine | Yes | The primary input is image files read from the local filesystem, which are processed by the library or CLI. |
| CI / Build System | Yes | The build and test pipelines run within a CI environment. |

# Entry Points

List the ways that external inputs reach the code. Mark whether they are trusted by design in this project. Be complete and exhaustive in you enumeration of all entry points. For example, include all API endpoints, all config files, etc., not just a few examples.

| Kind | Name | Internet-Exposed? | Trusted-by-Design? | Authentication | Intended User | Evidence |
|------|---------|-------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| CLI argument | `<image-file-path>` | No | No | Local Access | Local User | bin/image-size.js |
| Function | `imageSize(buffer)` | No | No | None | Library Consumer | lib/index.ts |
| Function | `imageSize(filePath)` | No | No | None | Library Consumer | lib/fromFile.ts |
| File content | Image file bytes | No | No | None | Library Consumer / Local User | lib/types/*.ts |

# Configuration and Deployment

Deployment context: This is a Node.js library intended to be published to a package registry like npm and used as a dependency in other projects. It also functions as a command-line tool for local execution.

Who controls configuration: The developer consuming the library or the end-user running the CLI tool.

Evidence: package.json

# Sensitive Data

| Data Type | Examples | Notes / Evidence |
|-----------|----------|------------------|
| Credentials | None | The application does not handle passwords, tokens, or API keys. |
| PII | None | The application's purpose is to read image dimensions and type, not personal user data. |
| Other | None | The application does not appear to process any other form of sensitive data. |

# Controls / Defenses

Only list if you can confirm from code or config.

| Control | Present? | Notes / Evidence |
|---------|----------|------------------|
| Authentication | No | The library is designed for local file processing and has no authentication mechanisms. |
| Input validation | Yes | The library validates file headers (magic numbers) to identify the image type before parsing. The presence of numerous invalid image fixtures suggests robustness testing. |
| Output encoding / CSP | No | Not applicable, as this is not a web rendering application. |
| Secrets management | No | The application does not handle secrets. |

# Key Assumptions

List any conditions the code assumes to be true that affect trust or exploitability.

“The CLI is run by a trusted user on the local machine.”

“The primary threat is from malformed or maliciously crafted image files intended to exploit the parsing logic.”

“The library consumer is responsible for handling exceptions thrown by the parser.”

# Summary

This project is a command-line tool and Node.js library for determining the dimensions of various image formats. Its primary attack surface is the parsing of image files, which are considered untrusted input. An attacker would be a user providing a malicious or malformed image file to be processed by the library, either through the CLI or by another application using this library. The main defense is input validation at the file format level, where each parser checks for specific byte patterns to identify and handle the corresponding image type. The application does not handle sensitive data, authentication, or network connections.
